Certainly! While I cannot directly access external websites from this environment, I can suggest a list of ATS-friendly job boards and websites where you can search for jobs that align with your resume. Given your skills and background in Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Data Analysis, the following platforms could be beneficial:

1. **LinkedIn Jobs**: Given that you have a LinkedIn profile, make sure to keep it updated. LinkedIn's job search feature is robust and will provide personalized job recommendations based on your profile.
  
2. **Indeed**: A popular global job search engine that integrates with many companies' ATS systems.

3. **Glassdoor**: Besides company reviews, Glassdoor also offers job listings. You can leverage the reviews to get insights into company cultures and interview processes.

4. **AngelList**: If you're interested in startups, AngelList is a great platform to find jobs in early to mid-stage companies.

5. **Kaggle Jobs Board**: Given your Machine Learning background, the Kaggle jobs board can be a good place to find data science and machine learning-specific roles.

6. **Monster**: Another global job search website, which also offers career advice and resume services.

8. **Stack Overflow Jobs**: Given your programming skills, Stack Overflow's job board can be a good fit. It's tailored for developers and includes many tech roles.

Remember:

- Always tailor your resume for each job application. Use relevant keywords from the job description to enhance your chances of passing through the ATS.
  
- Network! Sometimes, the best opportunities come from personal connections. Attend relevant webinars, online events, or conferences related to your field. Join forums or groups dedicated to Machine Learning and Data Analysis to stay updated and network with professionals in the industry.

Good luck with your job search!

While I can't directly access external websites to search for jobs, I can certainly guide you on how to effectively search for jobs on the platforms I mentioned.

Here are search term suggestions and strategies for each platform:

1. **LinkedIn Jobs**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Machine Learning Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Python Developer", "Big Data Engineer", "AI Specialist"
    - **Strategy**: Use the 'Easy Apply' feature for a quicker application process. Join groups related to your profession and participate in discussions to increase visibility.

2. **Indeed**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Machine Learning", "Data Analyst", "Data Engineer", "AI Developer", "Cloud Specialist AWS"
    - **Strategy**: Set up job alerts with these keywords so you receive daily or weekly emails with new job postings.

3. **Glassdoor**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Machine Learning Job", "Python Developer", "R Developer", "Big Data Specialist", "DevOps Engineer"
    - **Strategy**: Check out company reviews and interview experiences shared by others for insights.

4. **AngelList**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Startup Machine Learning", "AI Startup", "Data Science Startup"
    - **Strategy**: Create a detailed profile. Startups often look for a cultural fit as much as they do for technical skills.

5. **Kaggle Jobs Board**:
    - **Search Terms**: Since it's a niche board, simply browsing the latest postings could be effective.
    - **Strategy**: Participate in competitions. Often, companies notice top performers in relevant competitions.

6. **Monster**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Machine Learning Engineer", "Data Analysis", "Cloud Computing AWS", "Java Developer", "JavaScript Developer"

7. **SimplyHired**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Machine Learning Job", "Python Programming", "Big Data Analysis", "SQL Specialist", "DevOps AWS"
    - **Strategy**: Use the salary estimator tool to understand the pay range in different locations.

8. **Stack Overflow Jobs**:
    - **Search Terms**: "Python Developer", "R Developer", "Machine Learning", "Big Data Engineer", "Cloud Specialist"
    - **Strategy**: Make sure your Stack Overflow profile showcases your expertise and contributions.

When searching, make sure to also include the desired location unless you're looking for remote positions. Tailoring the search terms based on the platform's audience can also be more effective. For instance, Stack Overflow would be more tech and developer-focused, while LinkedIn might have a broader range of roles.

Remember, job titles might vary from company to company. While one company might have a role titled "Machine Learning Engineer", another might call the same role "AI Developer". So, try various combinations of these terms to get the most comprehensive list of available jobs.
